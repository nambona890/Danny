Some garbage that plays occasional Tourettes Guy soundbytes, depending on what windows you have open or other situations. Essentially a non-malicious version of the Tourette's Guy Trojan that was [featured on Danooct1's channel in a now-unlisted video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJXTygvctLY)

Keep in mind that once you run it, you won't be able to close it unless you end the process or restart Windows. However, unlike the original Tourettes Guy Trojan, you're allowed to open Task Manager to end the process.
